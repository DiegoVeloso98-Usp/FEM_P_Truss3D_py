# FEM nonlinear 3D Truss

Geometrically Non-Linear truss FEM code, written in python. Based on the Positional Finite Element Method. Theres 2 different codes, one for the static analysis and other for the dynamical analysis. 

The code reads a truss discretization in a specefic format.
 - After the solution, it outputs 2 different files, one which can be viewed with AcadView (Visualization software from SET-EESC, University of São Paulo (USP) )
